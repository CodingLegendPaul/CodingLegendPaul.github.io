Here are six tips for new gym starters</h2><p>Health and fitness isn’t just about what we look like it’s about what is going on in the inside too. It is important to know blood pressure levels, cholesterol and glucose levels and resting heart rate. The results of these tests, along with many more, will determine the intensity of your training and which exercises you should or shouldn’t be doing.
